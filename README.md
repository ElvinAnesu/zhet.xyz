# Zhet - Peer-to-Peer Currency Exchange Platform

Zhet is a modern peer-to-peer money exchange platform designed specifically for Zimbabweans in Zimbabwe and Tanzania. The platform addresses two main currency exchange scenarios:

## Problem Statement

### Cross-Border Exchange (Tanzania-Zimbabwe)
- Zimbabweans living in Tanzania who have Tanzanian Shillings (TZS) and/or US Dollars (USD)
- They seek individuals in Zimbabwe who have Zimbabwean Dollars (ZWG) and/or US Dollars (USD)
- The platform matches people based on their complementary currency needs

### Domestic Exchange (Within Zimbabwe)
- Zimbabwe operates with a dual currency system (ZWG and USD)
- Local Zimbabweans can exchange between these currencies through peer-to-peer matching
